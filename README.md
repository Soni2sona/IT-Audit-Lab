# 🛡️ Sonal's IT Audit Lab Portfolio

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to my **IT Audit Lab Portfolio** – a personal space where I practice and showcase real-world IT audit scenarios, tools, and frameworks. This lab is part of my continuous learning journey as I build hands-on experience in IT auditing, risk management, and cybersecurity compliance.

I created this GitHub repository to:
- Demonstrate my understanding of IT General Controls (ITGCs)
- Apply frameworks like SOX 404, ISO 27001, and NIST
- Share sample audit reports, evidence documentation, and control testing steps

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a hands-on IT audit lab environment
- Simulate common IT audit testing scenarios
- Perform control testing and risk assessments
- Write and document audit findings professionally

## 🧪 Projects Coming Soon
I'll be adding step-by-step audit projects, including:
- ✅ Access Control Testing
- ✅ Backup & Recovery Audit Walkthrough
- ✅ Log Monitoring with Splunk or Graylog
- ✅ Vulnerability Scan & Risk Analysis using Nessus/OpenVAS
- ✅ Sample SOX 404 & ISO 27001 Controls Testing
